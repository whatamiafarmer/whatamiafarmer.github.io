My research focuses on how literature and literary study have historically related to broader cultures of information and communication. My writing on this question in the context of British Romantic literature includes <a href='https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=30386'>**The Connected Condition: British Romanticism and the Dream of Communication**</a> (2020), which recasts Romantic poetry as a response to the beginnings of the information age. I also work in the field of computational literary studies, and have written collaborative papers on topics ranging from poetic form to plain writing. I'm currently writing an account of the role of computing in the history of literary studies in the U.S. My wider interests include the histories of reading, writing, rhetoric, communication and media, and literary criticism.

I studied at New York University, where I got my Ph.D. in English Literature in 2012. Before that I studied at Columbia University for my M.A. and McGill University for my B.A. Here's a recent short [CV]({{ www.whatamiafarmer.github.io }}/assets/pdf/igarashi_short_cv_website_04_2024.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
